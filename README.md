# Brisync
Synchronize your external display brightness with built-in display.

# How it works
Application reads current brightness of your built-in display and passes it to external displays via DDC interface.

You can adjust brightness by a menu in the system status bar or hotkeys:
- brightness down: ⇧ + ⌃ + F1,
- brightness up: ⇧ + ⌃ + F2.

Adjusting brightness in the menu changes internal brightness factor for this display so future brightness updates match your preferences.

# How to install
```{bash}
brew cask install brisync
```
